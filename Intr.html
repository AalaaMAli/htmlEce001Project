What does an Operating System means?
<br>
</br>
An operating system, known as OS, is a primary software that coordinates functions between computer soft 
and hard parts. Os, also, deals with the computer’s hardware and provides services that applications can use.
<br>
</br>
What jobs does operating system do?
<br>
</br>
The operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything communicated starting 
from keyboard, mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices ending with display monitor. In other words, it 
governs all input and output devices. In short, the operating system is the third-party that enables 
application and hardware devices communicate, for example, to print something from an application, the 
application delivers that job to the operating system, in turn, it sends the instructions to the printer 
through the printer’s drivers to send the right signals. Note, the application you use has not any care 
about what printer you have or understand how it works but the OS handles these details.
Moreover, in the big workstations, the operating system handles multi-tasking, allocating hardware 
resources among multiple running programs, where controls which processes will  run letting multiple 
processes run in parallel.
Noteworthy that, Operating Systems Aren’t Just for PCs, but also your smart phone, tablets, smart TVs, 
game consoles, smart watches, and Wi-Fi routers are also computers.
<br>
</br>
Classification of Operating systems
<br>
</br>
According to purposes and capacity, operating system may be classified into five categories, we can state 
in the following:

<br>•	Multi-user: Allows two or more users to run programs at the same time. Some operating systems permit 
hundreds or even thousands of concurrent users.</br>

<br>•	 Multiprocessing : Supports running a program on more than one CPU.</br>

<br>•	Multitasking : Allows more than one program to run concurrently.</br>

<br>•	Multithreading : Allows different parts of a single program to run concurrently.</br>

<br>•	Real time: Responds to input instantly. General-purpose operating systems, such as DOS and UNIX, 
are not real-time.</br>
<br>
</br>
Types of operating systems
<br>
</br>
The five most common and familiar operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Google’s 
Chrome OS, and Linux. The dominant smart phone operating systems are Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android.
