Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960s[1].  
Two decades before their modern forms, especially in the 1940s, the earliest electronic digital systems 
had no operating systems . Electronic systems of this time were special-purpose system . Actually, early 
computers were built to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator.  
<br>
</br>
After programmable general purpose computers were invented, machine languages (consisting of strings of 
the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape) were introduced that sped up the programming process. 
During the 1960s, IBM's OS/360 introduced the concept of a single OS spanning an entire product line, 
which was crucial for the success of the System/360 machines.  One notable early operating systems, 
had known as disk operating system, was closely imitated by Microsoft's MS-DOS and was supported on 
many early Pcs,  have been become widely popular as the operating system in the 1960s. In the 1980s, 
Apple Computer Inc. introduced the Apple Macintosh computer with an innovative graphical user 
interface (GUI) [2] to the Mac OS[3].
<br>
</br>
One of the operating systems originally written in assembly language is Unix and  "UNIX-like" which 
commonly refers to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original UNIX. [4].  MacOS  
is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed Apple Inc. which is pre-loaded on all currently  
Macintosh computers. Linux is Unix-like, but was developed without any Unix code that is posses a code is 
available for any modifications, that is  resulted in its  use on a wide range of computing machinery from 
supercomputers to smart-watches[5,6,7].  Further, Microsoft Windows is a family the most familiar and famous 
operating systems nowadays which are designed by Microsoft Corporation[8,9]. 
<br>
</br>
Additionally, mobile operating systems tend to emphasize efficient performance, user responsiveness and close 
attention to data handling tasks, such as supporting media streaming [10]. However, the most efficient and 
important operating system cuurently is the Network operating system. A network operating system (NOS) is 
another specialized OS intended to facilitate communication between devices operating on a local area 
network (LAN).  Further, in the field of industry, the Real-time operating system is basically essential.  
An example will make the situation clearer. For an industrial control system that may direct the operations 
of a sprawling factory or power plant. Such a facility will produce signals from myriad sensors and also send 
signals to operate valves, actuators, motors and countless other devices. In these situations, the industrial 
control system must respond quickly and predictably to changing real-world conditions -- otherwise, disaster 
may result.
<br>
</br>
In fact, without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the 
comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying computer, such as disk 
storage, network interfaces and so on [10].  For hardware functions such as input and output and memory 
allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware [11,12], 
although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls 
to an OS function or is interrupted by it.
